## Challenge

Create a simple website that mimics the Anomalie DressBuilder. In this project, a dress has two features: skirt silhouette (options: A-line, Sheath, Ballgown) and bodice style (options: Structured, Unstructured).

Combinations that are not permitted:

○ Ballgown and Unstructured

○ Sheath and Structured


This SPA is implemented in
 
○ React with React Hooks

○ Redux

○ Material UI components

○ React Hook Form for form library
